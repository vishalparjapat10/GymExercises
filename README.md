# GymExercises

## Introduction
GymExercises is a `react.js` based application which has been developed using **functional based components**. Generally, before going to gym or simply before doing exercises at home, we search for various exercises like chest, shoulders etc on google, youtube etc., which takes so much time to find the perfect video or results through which we can get the idea of different exercises, their posture and all. So I got an idea that can we put all exercises at one place with gifs or images & also with other features as well which will look good enough so that user can take interest in, so I created this app using data from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/hub). While created this app, I had fun & learned so much through this app.

## Description
So GymExercises is an app on which information of different exercises is available. It is also user friendly & smooth operating app. All the exercises data for this app is coming from [Exercises RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb/) api which has information for over 1300 exercises. [`react.js`](https://reactjs.org/), [`Material UI`](https://mui.com/) are the main technologies which are used to develop this app. This app includes below features :- 

* the app consists of exercises with their names & postures in which it is clearly mentioned that how a particular exercise should be done.
* each exercise also describes the part of the body that it targets & which equipment is used for doing a particular exercise.
* user can also search for any exercise by bodypart. For example if user enters **chest** & click `search` button then all the exercises related to chest will be shown
* if we click on a particluar exercise then we will be directed to detail page of that exercise. On that page there will be full information of the exercise, similar       equipment related videos & also there will be related youtube videos as well so that user can explore more for that particular exercise.
